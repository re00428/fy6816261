            Most speakers used today in your house, cinemas, lecture theatres and nightclubs use simple designs where a speaker driver is mounted
            in a sealed box or with basic ports at the back of the cabinet. What I will be discussing is a special type of speaker called Transmission
            lines. These recycle the sound energy from the rear-facing side of the speaker and direct it along a long (normally folded) pathway in
             the speaker enclosure thus changing the path difference of the sound waves (this is the difference in distance a wave travels to a point 
            compared to another). When tuned, it allows for a much better control of the energy produced by the speaker and improves the fidelity of
            the sound or more specifically the bass frequency responsiveness (how well a speaker reproduces bass frequencies).

            Transmission line speakers are a design of speaker enclosures which aims to improve the bass response and sound quality of speaker systems.
            There are various benefits for the speaker enclosure each allowing for different characteristics from other speaker enclosures. 
            One characteristic of transmission line speakers is that they act as an acoustic waveguide, this means that the casing is capable
            of guiding and controlling passively the waves radiated out of the speaker, this is useful as manufacturers can more precisely control 
            and manage the sound produced by the speaker. This is especially used in the lower frequencies (Colloms Martin, Darlington Paul. 2005).
